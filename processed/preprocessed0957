A visit to the family doctor for say a cold or <unk> ankle could also lead to a diagnosis of a mental disorder .
C. n. n.'s andrew holtz explains how .
In less than ten minutes a physician used to treating physical aches and pains can run a check of a patient's mental health .
I can see from the questionnaire that a lot of different things have been bothering you in the last month .
The screening system is called prime m. d. short for primary care evaluation of mental disorders .
It's developers say a study of a thousand patients found prime m. d. diagnoses are accurate .
By accurate we mean they had very good agreement with diagnoses made by a mental health professional a psychologist and a psychiatric social worker .
As seen in this demonstration prime m. d. starts with the patient filing out a questionnaire about mood anxiety eating and alcohol use .
The reason for creating a mental health exam to be used by primary care physicians is that's where the patients are .
It's estimated that twenty to thirty five percent of the patients seeing a primary care physician have a mental disorder and these are usually disorders that are quite <unk> .
The research reported in the journal of the american medical association was funded by the company that sells prime m. d. .
While the test may be quick and accurate for doctors to use it may not be easy for patients to get treatment because insurance plans often restrict mental health coverage .
Of course we're very concerned about patients with mental disorders being discriminated and not given the kind of reimbursement that patients with other disorders are .
