Oklahoma was my first show .
It wasn't the first show i'd done but it was the first show i wasn't fired from and it turned out to be very successful .
And <unk> was harder to do much harder for me but it was it turned out to be a very successful show .
Paint your wagon i think was better dances than even oklahoma or <unk> but it wasn't as good a show .
De <unk> used dances like oklahoma s writers oscar hammerstein and richard rodgers used words and music to explore character .
She elevated the status of dance in the musical by making it an integral part of the action .
I think she brought ballet into the musical theater more than <unk> who only had one or two but i think his was dances that <unk> the play .
<unk> furthered it and told a story and gave you insights into characters .
The first time <unk> said please will the whole cast please sit in the theater and watch this i said to alfred if we can get half as much reality into the book as she has gotten in this ballet it will be a hell of a hit .
During her career she won tony awards for the nineteen forty seven production of <unk> and the nineteen sixty two production of <unk> .
