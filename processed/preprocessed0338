Their art is as old as the human race .
The men would come down to the beach early and dig a huge pit .
Once there was a man who was successful in all things .
And as new as your last lunchtime laugh .
Right then and there she knew that bear was after uncle ike .
They tell us about where we came from .
It was a nineteen fifty five columbia r. x. five coaster bike .
They are the storytellers .
This is a. b. c. news nightline .
Substituting for ted koppel and reporting from washington chris wallace .
What you are about to see is not your usual nightline .
All year long we bring you stories of political controversy of diplomatic intrigue of corruption .
But tonight we want you to listen to some real storytellers celebrating one of america's oldest traditions .
Long before we crowded into theaters to see jurassic park or some other hot movie we used to sit around a fire or on a front porch and actively participate in telling or listening to a good yarn .
The fine art of storytelling is enjoying something of a renaissance this summer at <unk> around the country .
Folks seem to like to hear about people's lives or about the life of this country .
So pull up a chair and gather around your television set tonight and listen to four storytellers who are on martha's vineyard for a storytelling festival .
One of our childhood fears is of course fear of the unknown .
One of the basic versions of that fear is fear of people we don't quite understand and this story's built around the childhood fear of a person whose name we knew but we never saw who spent most of his time under the porch on the front of his house .
It was a nineteen fifty five columbia r. x. five coaster bike weighed eighty four pounds .
Strongest bicycle ever made .
Holds six kids .
We'd go to the top of east street hill and load up one in the basket on the front three in the middle two on the back then as fast as we could down the hill east street hill .
At the bottom we'd put on the brakes lean into the curve by the <unk> house .
As soon as we had safely made it around the curve we'd look back to the <unk> house and holler <unk> .
<unk> we were out of there .
<unk> you could hear it on commercials on the radio lucky strike means fine tobacco but that's not what we meant .
When we went past the <unk> house turned back and screamed we meant lord save me from terrell .
<unk> we were out of there .
One day we had made that trip five times started back to the hill to go down once more and we saw howard bryson the mailman .
Howard had delivered the mail all the way up the hill and started his wasted walk back to the bottom and we wondered do you think howard would like a ride david morgan pushed the bicycle up to the mailman .
They talked for a few minutes and all of a sudden they loaded up .
U. s. mail in the basket on the front eleven year old kid <unk> fifty three year old mailman on the luggage rack on the back here they came .
First thing i wondered was do we go that fast .
It was a blur and sparks were coming up under the bicycle .
We got out in the street to see them go by .
We didn't see much .
It was a wind something went chunk in the street .
It was the broken sprocket chain .
And we watched as the u. s. mail a forty three year old mailman an eleven year old boy <unk> backwards as fast as he could all traveled on an eighty four pound bicycle with no brakes straight toward terrell <unk> house .
We started running after them trying to figure out which way are they gonna go .
There's no way they can make that big curve .
But right at the end of the house there was an open space about three feet wide and then a big holly bush went all the way to the <unk> house .
We started running after them seeing that they were going to try to hit that one open space .
The bicycle hit the curb didn't throw their aim off they were going to make it .
And then at the last possible moment <unk> out from under the porch came terrell <unk> standing up in that one open space .
There was no way left to go but the holly bush .
In thirty seconds the sky was filled with little bits of <unk> holly leaves .
U. s. mail floated down out of the sky from park drive to hammer avenue .
Holly leaves all over the air sixty pieces of red and white bicycle moving around the yard .
We came running up and for the first time in our lives we saw terrell <unk> .
There he stood six feet tall a big middle aged child .
Howard looked at him and said terrell why did you come out from under your porch terrell took his thumb out of his mouth and said <unk> and i thought oh <unk> howard said what does that mean terrell he said my mama says when they holler that it means let's stop make friends terrell .
I always knew someday you were coming .
Our storytellers weave more tales when we come back .
Once there was a man who was successful in all things .
I think that's such a delicious idea .
He had a loving family he had real friends and he had a crop that had brought him a great deal of money and for which he could be justly proud .
But he was not happy and he told his wife he'd never be happy not until he knew truth .
She said then you should seek truth .
Well he put all his worldly goods in his wife's name she was adamant on that point and then he set out .
He was a lonely beggar on the road searching for truth .
He traveled well you know from all the stories you know what kind of journey it was over mountains and through valleys .
He traveled for days and for weeks and for months and he finally found truth .
She was a <unk> old woman sitting in a cave high on a mountaintop .
Her hair hung in greasy strands she had one tooth in her mouth and her skin was the color and the texture of dried parchment .
She motioned him into the cave with a hand that was <unk> with age but when she spoke her voice was low and lyrical and pure and he knew he knew he had found truth .
Well he stayed with her for a year and a day and he learned everything he was capable of learning and at the end of the time he said you've given me my heart's desire .
Is there anything that i can do for you .
She considered this .
She cocked her head to one side she raised an ancient finger and she said yes .
When you go out there and you speak of me tell them all that i am young and beautiful .
I want to tell you the story about uncle ike .
Uncle ike was the man that invented the <unk> .
The <unk> was the device that he made by taking a groundhog hide and tacking it in a broken <unk> <unk> it in there just as tight as a drum .
Then he took a long wire put a bit knot in the end of that wire ran it all the way down the hill to granny <unk> house about a half mile .
And she had one of these groundhog hides <unk> in her window too so that wire went right from the middle of uncle <unk> <unk> right to the middle of granny <unk> and they could stand at either end of that thing and talk to each other .
They had a special signal when they wanted to talk .
It was three taps .
Tap tap tap .
Hey granny how are you .
Oh just as fine as frog hair uncle ike .
Oh granny .
Now what granny liked best about that <unk> was when she could get uncle ike up early in the morning about five o'clock a. m. and get him to play his <unk> up at his house so she could do a little buck dancing down at her house for exercise .
She always wanted the same tune .
She would tap on the <unk> uncle ike would rub his eyes get his <unk> and play just as loud as he could so granny could dance at her house .
Now what uncle ike liked best about the <unk> was when he could get granny to put her <unk> radio up against her end of the thing at her house so he could hear the latest tunes of the day up at his house tunes like uncle dave <unk> keep my <unk> good and greasy .
Keep my <unk> good and greasy all the time time time slash keep my <unk> good and greasy all the time .
Now they had a special signal when uncle ike didn't feel like talking and just wanted to listen to the radio that was five taps but on the day i want to tell you about he tapped three times .
He felt like talking .
Tap tap tap .
Hey granny how you do .
Oh i do just like i want to uncle ike .
How do you do .
Oh not so good .
You see there's been a big old bear coming up here the last few nights and well old blue's been barking and scaring him off but now blue's run off with some other old dog and i don't know what i'm gonna do tonight .
Well <unk> gonna have to sit up and wait for that bear 'cause if he comes in on you he'll just wring your neck .
Well i guess you're right granny .
Well i'll talk to you in the morning .
Well .
So that night uncle ike got his <unk> his shotgun a big old pot of coffee and slid his rocking chair out on the front porch gonna sit out there and wait for that bear to come back .
He sat out there and picked every tune he knew waiting for that bear and he didn't have to repeat a one 'cause he knew so many .
Finally that morning sun started to come up over the hill .
It felt so warm and good and uncle ike was so tired been up all night long .
Hadn't seen hide nor hair of that bear .
So he thought he'd just slide that rocking chair back in the house and pick a tune or two and catch a few winks .
He pushed the chair back in the house he leaned back and started to play but he was so tired he fell right to sleep .
He was awakened by an awful scratching sound .
When he looked up there in his doorway was the biggest ten foot black bear he'd ever seen coming right for him .
Well he leaned back with the end of that <unk> .
It hit on that <unk> just as hard as he could trying to get <unk> attention .
Granny was down at her house .
She heard those five taps and figured uncle ike wanted to listen to the radio .
She went over turned on the radio .
She went back to her cooking and she heard this coming through her end of the <unk> <unk> .
Right then and there she knew that bear was after uncle ike .
She turned up that radio just as loud as it would go grabbed her shotgun and ran out the door run up the hill to uncle <unk> house .
She comes around the corner of his house she sees that bear run out the door he's got something long and thin in his paw looks like one of uncle <unk> arms or legs or something .
She takes the gun and she shoots rap rap and she missed .
Lord it was just as quiet as it could be .
She was afraid to look around the corner 'cause she didn't know what would be left of uncle ike but she knew she had to peep around the corner and she did .
And there uncle ike was just sitting there and shaking .
He said oh granny you saved my life .
When you turned up that radio that bear stepped back and did the finest little buck dance i ever saw .
Then he started coming at me granny with them big old long claws .
<unk> i thought he was coming for my neck .
But he didn't grab my neck he grabbed my <unk> and went running right out of here .
What do you suppose that bear would want with my <unk> granny .
Well uncle ike was never bothered by the bear again after that but he said that sometimes late at night when everything was still he thought he could hear that old bear trying to pick out a tune on that <unk> .
Well i grew up here on martha's vineyard in the fifties and the memory of the beach parties that were full day situations for us were the lure of summer being completely captivated by the sea and the sky and the sand and that it could last all day long .
And you know how long a day is in the summer when you're a child it is forever .
In the early morning the men would come down and dig a big pit and they would place three big wooden barrels down inside of it and they'd pull a <unk> across the top and secure it with rocks .
And then they would wait for us to come down to the beach because they would have built a great huge fire with rocks all lining the underneath of it and it would be burning and burning up into the sky .
And we would come tumbling over the beach in the old <unk> the thing packed to the <unk> with all kinds of things that would keep us settled in for a whole day at the beach .
People would come ten twenty thirty as the day wore on and the men would wait for us and then they would head over to <unk> pond and go <unk> .
They'd go out and get <unk> and <unk> and they'd spend half the day over there with baskets tied into great <unk> so that the shellfish could stay underneath the water and remain fresh while they kept on fishing .
We'd play all day at the beach and then there would be some moment when they were all done with what they had to do .
They'd bring back the lobsters and the <unk> and the <unk> they'd come over the dunes and we'd be ready .
Everybody would come running up to the fire and they'd say okay everybody stand back we've got to do this thing and we don't want anybody to get burned .
And as we'd step back from all of that they'd pull open the <unk> and those barrels would be sitting there just gaping and waiting .
They'd roll those rocks out of the old fire that had burned way down with the <unk> <unk> and they'd push the rocks into the bottoms of the barrels .
The boys would run down to the rocks and they'd pull off the <unk> and they'd come <unk> back with great <unk> of the stuff .
One bucket of water on each rock and then seaweed and great <unk> of steam flying up into the air and all of us standing back watching all of this spewing forth the place where the magic would happen .
And then down into that seaweed would go the basket for the shellfish .
The <unk> and the <unk> would go in and then the boys would bring more seaweed and those would go down inside .
And then would go the lobsters and on top of that more seaweed and then on top of that all the corn that we had <unk> during the day and then on top of that another layer of seaweed and then potatoes and <unk> that wonderful sausage that would send its spices <unk> all the way through all the rest of the layers and on top of that one more layer of seaweed .
And then the <unk> would be pulled across again and the rocks securing it .
We would be warned one more time not to go near it so that no one would get burned .
And then everybody would go off for one last swim .
When they came back out it was too cold for wet <unk> suits and they'd hop in the jeep .
And we had put <unk> all around the windows to make a dressing room and they would have gotten sweatshirts and jeans on .
And then everybody would be waiting .
It was a quieter time of the day and most of the people had left the beach except for us .
And there would be some moment when somehow someone knew that it was just the right time and they would pull the rocks back from the <unk> and as soon as that <unk> was pulled back there would be these wonderful wonderful volcanic <unk> of steam up into the air and we'd all watch it rise up and dissipate into the sky .
And then with the <unk> they'd pull back all of the seaweed and haul out the baskets with the potatoes and the <unk> and more seaweed and then the corn and then more seaweed and then how did those lobsters go in green and blue and come out red we all wondered nobody knew .
More seaweed and then all the shellfish in the baskets and the table would sag with all that wonderful food .
It was just delicious to see the colors the yellow of the corn and the lobsters so red .
And everyone would get their plates and their plastic <unk> and knives and as much paper <unk> as they needed to tuck into their chin so they didn't dribble butter on everything .
And then we would walk all the way round the table and look at it all and get enough on our plates so settling down into the sand would be a one time deal .
Everybody would just get silent and everyone would eat .
There were moans and <unk> of pleasure because it was so fabulous but other than that there was no conversation .
And when it was all finished the end of the day would be playing around <unk> and sending signs across the sky .
We'd pack everything up into the back of the <unk> the dog would come <unk> across the sand jump and hang on the end of the <unk> and we'd go rolling across the dunes .
And as we headed on home the sky would be sending a wash of pastels of <unk> and indigo and peaches across the sky reaching all the way to spain .
And we'd go home everybody quiet in the jeep thinking how we had just spent one of those <unk> vineyard days .
And that's our report for tonight .
I'm chris wallace in washington .
