Hello .
I'm lou waters at c. n. n. center .
C. n. n. has been monitoring iraqi television where an iraqi television announcer has just said that saddam hussein and the revolutionary command council is calling for a stop to all shooting by the iraqis as of january twentieth at eight a. m. baghdad time .
That would be midnight eastern time tonight .
This is being done as an offer to the new united states administration to allow time for any talks to take place without fear of shooting according to the iraqi television announcement .
This is a unilateral cease fire offered by the iraqis .
The announcer went on to say the shooting would stop so long as they are not fired upon .
This is a statement a cease fire announced unilaterally by the iraqis to take effect midnight eastern time tonight eight a. m. baghdad time .
