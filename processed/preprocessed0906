Well as we told you at the top of the show the italian cruise ship the <unk> lauro is burning off the coast of somalia .
And joining us by telephone right now is italian coast guard lieutenant andrea <unk> .
Lieutenant what can you tell us .
We understand you're in contact with a tanker that is in the area of the <unk> lauro .
Lieutenant can you hear me .
Yes very low .
Can you tell me what you've heard from the tanker in the area .
Okay .
What can i can tell you at the moment is that the <unk> lauro is on fire and is <unk> on its side by forty degrees .
Part of the crew a number of one hundred are still on board trying to fight the fire at the moment .
All the passengers which are about five hundred eighty people are on the <unk> and are picked up at the moment by the tanker hawaiian king which is a panama flagship .
And did i hear you say .
And some other .
Go ahead .
And some other ships are in the area about thirty miles away from the disaster area and are heading to the area to give assistance to the people .
And the ship the <unk> lauro sailed from haifa port in israel and of the passenger we know that twenty one are italian and the rest are of various nations .
But we are waiting for a passenger and crew list from haifa by fax so i can tell you later about the exact nationality of the passengers .
What i can tell you for sure is there are no injuries no deaths absolutely nothing for the passengers or crew .
Lieutenant can you tell us where they're taking the passengers .
I couldn't hear .
I'm sorry .
That's all right .
Lieutenant can you tell us where they're taking the passengers .
What happened to the passengers .
Where are they going now .
Oh where are they going .
We don't know exactly .
We'll try to coordinate with kenya or saudi arabia to send them in an available port where diplomatic authorities of the italian government are to take care of them .
So we are trying to coordinate this at the moment .
All right .
Thank you very much for joining us .
