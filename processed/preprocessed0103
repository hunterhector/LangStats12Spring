<unk> <unk> is picking up the pieces of her life for a second time .
An <unk> jet bombed her home the night before .
The family had been uprooted once before and fled <unk> the <unk> capital when the dispute over <unk> karabakh first erupted .
Four days before the bombing here in <unk> her husband dreamed it might happen and moved her and the children into a nearby village .
As bad as things were we never imagined that early in the morning while children slept in their beds that such things could fall out of the sky .
Under that rubble was the family bedroom .
We weren't home .
I look at that i see that and i thank great god that he saved us .
Given the destruction and carnage in <unk> karabakh it's difficult to imagine the optimism of the armenian president .
Of course if you look back in history our armenian fate appears tragic but you must look to the future .
Certainly our present is in no way analogous to our past .
That past includes the turks in <unk> having taken away much that was traditionally armenian territory .
That's mount <unk> symbol of the armenian nation .
It sits in turkey and the armenians don't have the force to take it back .
But in the other direction lies <unk> karabakh inside modern day azerbaijan and the <unk> government figures those turks don't have the strength to hold onto to that part of the armenian homeland .
But in attempting to regain karabakh the armenians have nearly destroyed their own economy .
The rail yards are silent in <unk> they were busy before the war transporting goods through azerbaijan .
Not the lines are <unk> .
This nuclear reactor not far outside <unk> was shut down a year ago .
The people president ter <unk> at the head feared another earthquake could cause a nuclear disaster .
It may soon reopen .
Much of the country goes without electricity now for long periods .
Ironic that the same sort of pragmatism that led the soviets to build the plant here in the first is now pushing the independent armenians to open it .
It's been staffed throughout the closing workers paid but not laboring .
But for refugees like <unk> <unk> the war must go on to save <unk> karabakh .
The fight she says is worth the suffering .
Of course it is of course .
It was all started by the <unk> .
The armenians raised their hands to vote the <unk> raised <unk> and axes over our heads over the heads of children .
That's not right .
But at risk in this horrendous intractable feud is a whole generation of youngsters .
