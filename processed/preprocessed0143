Another u. s. computer maker about to launch a salvo in the japanese market by offering more computer for less money .
Compaq computer today will drastically undercut personal computer prices in japan .
That move could start a price war in the world's second largest computer market .
Todd benjamin reports from tokyo .
Compaq isn't a household name in japan but the houston based computer company well known for its aggressive pricing in the united states now has its sites set on japan .
The fact of matter is the japanese customer has been paying more than anybody else in the rest of the world and i think that's unfair .
So i think it is fair to offer the best quality products at the you know the best price .
<unk> cheapest model in japan will sell for one hundred twenty eight thousand yen or just over one thousand dollars .
That's about half the cost of the lowest priced machine offered by n. e. c. the market leader .
Compaq also <unk> the competition on other p. c. machines it offers in hopes its low priced strategy will be an attractive alternative for the word processing crowd .
N. e. c. says its pricing won't be affected by <unk> more machine for less money move .
Japan unlike the united states hasn't experienced fierce price wars but compaq could change that .
I don't think the impact of this is going to be seen immediately .
It's going to be happening over a period of years but you'll see the market shares begin to deteriorate for the japanese majors unless they come out with a very aggressive pricing strategy .
Compaq which began selling personal computers in japan earlier this year has less than one percent of a market valued at four point six billion dollars .
N. e. c. has over fifty percent .
While japan the world's second largest computer market offers much promise <unk> aggressive move into the market comes at a time when making significant headway could be tough .
Japan is in the midst of an economic slowdown and computer sales are down .
