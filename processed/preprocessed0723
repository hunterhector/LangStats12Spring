Drug prices also under pressure .
Drug makers turning out low cost versions of the some of the industry's biggest <unk> .
The latest example is <unk> <unk> .
The patent on its popular anti ulcer drug tagamet expired tuesday opening the door to a flood of generic <unk> .
But as terry keenan reports <unk> <unk> refuses to back down .
Generic versions of tagamet were being shipped to pharmacies wednesday one day after its patent expired .
But along with those shipments was <unk> own low cost substitute for its popular anti ulcer drug .
Like many big drug companies <unk> is going head to head with the generic competition and analysts say with little choice .
Previously it would take about two years to lose about fifty percent of your sales when we were not in such period of healthcare cost containment .
But that's no longer the case .
With competition fierce and patients price conscious prices down drop sharply soon after a patent expires .
The price of <unk> <unk> fell eighty percent just twenty four hours after it lost patent protection last year .
Today forty five percent of all prescriptions filled are for generic drugs up sharply from ten years ago .
But it's the <unk> of the world not their generic competitors that are expected to cash in on the shift to <unk> .
Just about every major drug company now has its own generic unit and large buyers such as h. m. o.'s are taking notice .
Drug companies are now bundling together their brand name and generic drugs offering them at a special price .
They will be so price competitive that they will retain anywhere from fifty to seventy five percent of that particular <unk> market .
That's going to leave very very little business to existing generic drug producers .
It's going to put tremendous pressure on their profit margins and i think expectations on wall street are not going to be met .
And the stakes for major pharmaceutical companies will continue to grow .
By the end of the decade two hundred more drugs with twenty two billion dollars in sales will be coming off patent .
