For the latest on bill clinton's efforts to transform election pledges into acceptable policies we turn to c. n. n. senior white house correspondent wolf blitzer .
Good morning wolf .
Good morning donna .
Here at the white house right now the president is meeting with his top economic advisers focusing in on his legislative agenda that's going to be submitted presumably in the next few weeks as part of his state of the union address .
But later this afternoon in about five hours at four o'clock eastern time the president is scheduled to meet for the first time with all six members of the joint chiefs of staff .
General colin powell the chairman of the joint chiefs will be coming over here with the other chiefs and the key issue of course on the agenda as you mentioned is the president's campaign commitment to lift the ban on homosexuals serving in the military .
This is a pledge that the president clearly wants to fulfill but is coming under sharp criticism from the senior military brass as well as from some members of congress in the senate as well as in the house of representatives .
The president is trying to find a way to meet that campaign commitment smoothly .
Defense secretary les aspin will of course be participating in that meeting .
He has some various compromise proposals designed to spread out the implementation of this commitment over the next several months .
No word on how the chiefs will react .
