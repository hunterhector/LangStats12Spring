The number two draw at the movie box office this past weekend was a new p. g. rated sports comedy called the mighty ducks starring emilio <unk> .
C. n. n.'s carol <unk> has a review .
The mighty <unk> aspires to be the bad news <unk> on ice but it falls far short of that movie's subversive <unk> .
Emilio <unk> is <unk> as a hot shot young lawyer whose psyche was twisted when he failed to score the crucial point in a pee wee hockey game .
He gets a chance to heal his inner child when he's sentenced to do community service as yes you guessed it the hockey coach of a bunch of <unk> kids .
<unk> lacks the physical presence and the performance art to carry this role .
The kids themselves are okay although the characters they play are cardboard cliches .
The script is predictable the directing pedestrian .
While the grade school set probably will <unk> up over the on screen antics of the mighty ducks anyone over age ten is likely to consider these birds a bunch of frozen turkeys .
