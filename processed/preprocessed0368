Their called wrap fee accounts and they are a fast growing segment of the financial services industry .
Steve young reports on this no frills approach to investing in today's edition of your money .
Investors are pouring about fifteen million dollars a day into wrap fee accounts .
Wraps provide investors with a range of services for a flat percentage charge .
Brokers match investors with money managers who select stocks and bonds to suit the investors' needs otherwise known as asset <unk> .
But the rap on wrap accounts has been high fees at big wall street firms still around three percent of the assets being managed .
That's three thousand dollars on a one hundred thousand dollar account .
Competition for a part of this sixty billion dollar market is bringing down fees and offering investors more choices .
Enter mutual fund companies and independent investment advisers whose fees reflect lower overhead and access to no load mutual funds .
The mutual funds and the independent investment advisers what they're doing is using the publicly owned mostly no load mutual funds to spread that money around to meet that asset <unk> .
It's cheaper and it tends to be a little more efficient .
Mutual fund wraps put your money into stock or bond funds .
The fee is about one percent of total assets plus the fund's annual fees which can be another one percent .
The fee is about two thousand dollars on a one hundred thousand dollar account .
Investment adviser fees are even lower ranging from three quarters of one percent to one point five percent including fund costs .
That will cost you about one thousand dollars in fees .
And as fees come down so are minimum investments bringing more small investors into the market .
