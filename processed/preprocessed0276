From the world beneath the sea humans constantly are discovering ways to better all our lives .
One of the latest could lead to some earth friendly technology .
C. n. n. science correspondent miles o'brien has more on this pearl of a material .
Part of this <unk> extracted from oyster shells is a protein called <unk> .
It helps <unk> survive by controlling how their shells grow and now a synthetic version of the same protein may help people protect the environment .
Scientists at <unk> university have figured out how to make the <unk> protein in the laboratory .
They're hoping it may soon be used in products ranging from <unk> to disposable diapers as an alternative to some of the non <unk> chemicals now in use .
And they are used in enormous quantities .
We're talking about hundreds of millions of pounds of these being used .
The chemicals called <unk> are used to prevent particles in water from clumping together .
In the case of <unk> they keep dirt from sticking together in the wash water and getting back onto clean clothes or dishes .
They're also used in boilers and cooling towers to keep mineral scale from building up and blocking pipes and they're used in the super <unk> materials that soak up liquid in disposable diapers .
<unk> research started with the oyster protein .
Because of the way it helps control development of the shell he figured it might also be able to control mineral build up in other situations .
And because it's a protein he knew it would be <unk> .
The question was where to get enough of the protein to experiment with .
We immediately recognized that one couldn't use either natural systems to make enough protein or we couldn't extract enough protein for heaven's sake from <unk> or anything else for the kind of applications we're talking about .
So they had to learn exactly what was in the protein and then come up with a way to make it in the lab .
Wheeler says the process could easily be scaled up for use in industry .
A form of the chemical that would work in detergents is almost ready for market .
We're talking really about only months to less than a year before that could happen .
But wheeler points out it's up to manufacturers whether they switch to the <unk> chemicals because there's no law requiring them to choose it .
Developing a form of <unk> for use in disposable diapers is further down the road but it holds the potential for making tons of landfill garbage more <unk> .
