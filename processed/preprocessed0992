Does talent run in the family .
In the case of the <unk> the answer seems to be yes .
Fledgling director david <unk> has a film in theaters now called miami <unk> .
David's brother operates in a different media arena and their father in yet a third .
C. n. n. entertainment correspondent bill tush introduces us to the <unk> family .
A former t. v. writer turned film director that's david <unk> .
Meet <unk> brother jon .
Formerly a sportscaster this <unk> now a reporter on the today show .
Very tough assignment jon and you're getting paid for this .
Can you believe it .
What are you doing tomorrow .
We're going to go <unk> .
Sounds fun .
Father <unk> is max .
When he was an executive editor for the new york times he found himself winning a pulitzer prize .
I think basically the first thing that pushed me toward broadcasting as opposed to writing because obviously that's where the family roots were were that i was somebody who talked .
You know when you have no talent in front of the camera you'd better get behind the camera pretty quick .
<unk> david has a diploma from harvard and before directing his first feature miami <unk> he found writing and producing for television perfectly fine .
But he knew filmmaking was in his future even before he got to the fourth grade .
It must have been in third grade but i directed jon in a film of <unk> and the <unk> and jon plays the <unk> in a brilliant performance one of the great death scenes in cinema history .
<unk> <unk> buying the farm was his film finale .
He found playing football for syracuse fun but it was when the famous bob costas caught <unk> sports reporting things really started to fly .
Now he's a <unk> at the today show and young <unk> couldn't find a bigger fan than brother dave .
In climbing you need the agility of a <unk> and the focus of a chess player .
I think he's a real t. v. star .
He has some <unk> charisma that makes everybody enjoy watching him .
Meanwhile jon <unk> sees david having his own fabulous feature .
People are going to quickly identify him as one of the true superstars of a certain type of moviemaking .
It's a real low pressure family where we have no expectations of each other at all .
You can bet if either <unk> ends up in a hall of fame no one will be more proud than their father .
We see him wander down in his underwear to tune into the today show so he won't miss a second of jon and he you know drove me over to the theater the other day to see the lines around the corner for miami <unk> .
For now everything is just fine for the <unk> family frankly .
