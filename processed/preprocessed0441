As the israelis and palestinians forge their new working relationship very little is said about one group of west bank palestinians that's very wary of the planned israeli troop withdrawal .
As c. n. n.'s bill delaney reports they have more to fear from their own people than from the israelis .
A mid morning stillness of a place most palestinians consider a village of the damned the last stop palestinians say for traitors <unk> in the northern west bank where israel provides safe haven alongside an israeli military outpost for palestinians accused by other palestinians of collaborating with israeli security services .
No one in <unk> doubts what will happen if israeli troops as scheduled pull out of much of the west bank next year to be replaced by palestinian self rule and yasir arafat's p. l. o. .
<unk> <unk> is the local <unk> or town leader .
If i stay here and the p. l. o. coming here you think that they caring me to give me food .
They're hungry .
The <unk> says all he's guilty of is refusing to give up his job as a construction worker at a jewish settlement on the west bank .
Palestinians accuse people in <unk> of much worse .
Hundreds of palestinians have been murdered for collaboration for allegedly getting fellow palestinians thrown in jail tortured and killed .
<unk> ibrahim says fellow palestinians accused him of being a spy for the israelis .
He shows wounds he says are from being tortured with red hot nylon before he fled to <unk> .
Now he says as far as he's concerned every drop of his palestinian blood has been replaced with jewish blood .
The just over one thousand palestinians in <unk> dream of a future in just one place .
All of the palestinians here in <unk> say they want refuge in israel if and when the p. l. o. takes over .
Israel may have taken a step in that direction .
People here say in recent days they've been promised the right to an israeli identity card .
Until the palestinians in <unk> reach their promised land though they remain surrounded by palestinian communities where they're despised and where their accusers say every day palestinian self rule approaches the day of reckoning for the people of <unk> approaches too .
