A mystery <unk> in new jersey .
It's been more than a week since exxon international president sidney <unk> disappeared while heading for work .
Now the picture's been clouded by unconfirmed reports <unk> may have been the victim of environmental terrorism .
Richard roth has the story .
After a virtual information blackout on the fate of sidney <unk> president of exxon international local prosecutors called a news conference .
Earlier the new york post reported that a law enforcement source said <unk> was kidnapped by a group calling itself rainbow warriors raising speculation of environmental terrorism .
The paper said a ransom note and phone calls were received .
But the morris county prosecutor would take no questions issuing a statement the heart of which dealt with the post kidnap story .
And it would be inappropriate for this office to discuss that report of a communication in the absence of verification that the communication is indeed from an individual or group holding mr. <unk> in custody .
Absent a current photograph or a voice recording this office cannot reach the conclusion that mr. <unk> is in the custody of any particular group .
Not an outright denial of the story plus a comment hinting that further communication is needed if <unk> is being held by anyone .
<unk> disappeared april twenty ninth as he left his suburban morris township home .
His car was found <unk> in the driveway .
Authorities have been tight lipped and in the wake of the post story the prosecutor had a warning for the media .
Furthermore we believe it to be ill advised for any media organization to publish <unk> and unidentified sources of information about a matter which has the potential to affect an individual's well being .
Exxon said it would have no comment on the <unk> case neither would the f. b. i. .
So the mystery continues with the authorities seemingly looking to hear from person or persons who might be holding the exxon executive .
