The action is heating up in movie theaters as the block buster summer films begin arriving .
Paramount's big gun is a sequel of sorts to the hunt for red <unk> all this week c. n. n.'s dennis michael previews patriot games .
Action .
Action .
For patriot games it's worth saying the word twice .
There's plenty of action in this tale of revenge and international terrorism with battles on land on sea and by air from the deserts of north africa to buckingham palace .
Well not actually buckingham palace .
We shot that at london at the greenwich naval college outside of london .
We were surrounded by fifteenth century and sixteenth century buildings with the original windows in them glass and as they say god forbid we had the explosion had knocked pictures off the walls or broken any of these windows .
Broken glass is one thing but multi million dollar talent like harrison ford and anne archer in the line of fire is an even greater concern .
This sometimes makes you a bit nervous but he prefers to fall and jump and crash and be there when the explosion goes off so we can actually see his face .
I've always told him that if the acting thing doesn't work out that i can use him as a <unk> and he's really good .
Not that there's anything wrong with action for <unk> sake in the film but in patriot <unk> director phillip <unk> was careful to have all action developed out of character such as this scene as jack is stalked by an assassin .
We go through jack's thought process as he first of all <unk> the presence of this man and then works out how he's going to foil the attack without getting injured himself and afterwards what the consequences and implications of this man actually attacking him might be for his own family .
So all of the action sequences try and reveal jack ryan's character .
Patriot <unk> makes its explosive debut on june fifth in theaters throughout the u. s. and canada .
