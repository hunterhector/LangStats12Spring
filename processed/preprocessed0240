Now here's the latest way to play the market .
A new investment trading on the american stock exchange for less than a week it has some traders flocking to it some <unk> running the other way .
Beverly schuch explains that one .
First it was spider man at the new york stock exchange now spiders are crawling all over the american exchange .
But stifle that scream .
The american stock exchange spiders try hard to be friendly .
Spider is a <unk> acronym for a standard and poor's depository receipt .
So what's that .
It's a new technically engineered equity that mirrors the performance of the standard and poor's five hundred index .
It's a security that looks tastes smells and feels just like a share of stock on the market .
Buying one spider at about forty four dollars allows investors to ride the s. and p. five hundred's moves at one tenth the price .
The spider also pays a dividend based on its fraction of the s. and p's dividends .
Right now that's about thirty to thirty five cents a share per quarter .
Spiders most closely resemble stock index mutual funds very popular with small investors lately .
The amex hopes to share that boom .
<unk> advantage is they can be traded moment by moment .
Mutual funds only allow you to get in or out at day's end .
The only real question investors should ask before taking these spiders home is whether a large stock broad market index is the place to be .
