One of the many conflicts the united nations is currently trying to mediate took a dramatic turn today .
In the former soviet republic of georgia separatist rebels in the northwestern region of abkhazia captured the <unk> capital <unk> .
The guerrillas who want an independent state in abkhazia took the city after an eleven day siege .
Georgia's leader eduard shevardnadze remained in <unk> throughout the siege but today he reportedly left the city .
From moscow npr's mike shuster has more .
Shevardnadze remained as close to the fighting in <unk> as he could without putting himself directly under the falling shells .
Only when it seemed today that the georgian troops fighting to hold onto the city's center were going to crack did shevardnadze leave his headquarters for a safer position believed to be located a few miles south of the city .
Shevardnadze issued a bitter statement through is office in <unk> georgia's capital blaming russia for the georgian defeat .
Russia had pledged to guarantee a cease fire both sides signed in late july but then the <unk> separatists broke the cease fire nearly two weeks ago and began the siege of <unk> russia did nothing and continued to do nothing throughout the battle .
During the year long war russia or at least local russian commanders have been accused of giving the rebels military support .
Georgia was practically on its knees the statement said from shevardnadze but even this was not enough for russia .
<unk> statement accused the <unk> of <unk> actions and said that hundred of people had been killed in the battle and many buildings destroyed .
One western correspondent who left the city on saturday reported that its coastline was lighted by fires .
Thousands of people have fled <unk> .
Today russian ships off the coast were reported to have evacuated seven thousand five hundred from the city .
Officials of the <unk> separatists said their troops were not attacking the retreating georgian forces .
The separatists also pledged to permit shevardnadze to leave the area unharmed .
Earlier russian president boris yeltsin offered to assist in getting shevardnadze out but the georgian leader refused .
The war for abkhazia broke out in august of last year and in sporadic fighting has left an estimated two thousand dead .
But the two sides had fought to a standstill this past july with the <unk> in control of most of the province but the georgians holding <unk> .
So they signed a cease fire and there was much hope a peace could be arranged .
Shevardnadze took the cease fire seriously and ordered heavy weapons removed from the city .
When the <unk> broke the cease fire the georgians were exposed and nearly helpless .
Where this leaves georgia's battered government is not immediately clear .
The <unk> control most of the province including its most important cities .
Today they offered to begin peace talks in geneva later this week .
Assuming shevardnadze is safe it is not certain that he will survive politically after this defeat .
A spokesman in <unk> said he would remain near the city to oversee the evacuation of refugees .
Today in the statement he released he sounded saddened and sober .
God knows i did all i could so that this terrible day would never come the statement read .
May i be forgiven it continued by my contemporaries and those who come after me .
