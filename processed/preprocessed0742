Animals do the darnedest things and bears are no exception .
Things were up in the air in virginia beach virginia this week when residents discovered this bear up a tree .
I mean it was really weird to see it in a residential area like that .
The bear seemed to be enjoying his <unk> perch but officers wanted him down .
So they fired a <unk> dart and the <unk> bear fell to the earth .
Wildlife experts theorize it came from a nearby swamp so they took him back home after an examination could bear out .
The sleepy intruder was o. k. .
People can drop precipitously too like when they're on a rip roaring water slide .
Now there's a new design that turns convention upside down a water slide that sends people uphill .
There's nothing quite like the wet and wild drop of a water slide and there's nothing quite like this slide .
It can also blast riders uphill .
Sliding uphill .
Isaac newton is spinning in his grave .
It's a new slide called the master <unk> .
It's like a roller coaster on h. two o. powerful water jets or <unk> can easily boost two people up a fifteen degree <unk> .
The <unk> inventor tom <unk> says it's unlike any other water slide .
The difference with the master <unk> is when you get in the tube and you start and you hit the first <unk> the first thing you notice is the <unk> the sensation .
It's just like that thing hits you and it just picks you up and you go whoa .
You know just like you feel this thing which is unknown .
You haven't felt that experience before .
Actually <unk> has made a ride that's similar to the master <unk> .
The flow rider simulates surfing with sheets of water sent over a specially shaped hill .
<unk> has spent years developing his rides .
Besides designing them he also served as test pilot which during the early days called for protective gear .
While the idea may seem simple making the master <unk> work took some careful engineering .
We're bringing the water uphill .
On the other hand we have to be able to vent that water because as the water slows down it wants to puddle up .
And that's what took us so long to perfect .
Very very difficult to obtain that proper balance but we've done it now .
So we're excited .
Riders can go solo or in <unk> <unk> .
Either way they hit water rushing at a rate of over twenty gallons a second .
Besides the fun factor the water also keeps riders from <unk> up .
The park owner says the master <unk> has potential to change the way water parks work .
We'll be able to do away with <unk> starting platforms and really eliminate the long waits that are generally accustomed to water slides .
The first master <unk> open to the public is at the <unk> water park in texas which helped design and build the ride .
Other parks in the u. s. and around the world have also expressed interest .
So roll over newton .
Water rides like this seem to be taking off .
Time for us to slip slide away .
Thanks for watching .
I'm miles o'brien .
Ever wonder what the inside of a dinosaur skull looks like .
