Hockey is of course king in canada but for the next several days canadians will shift their attention to an american institution .
C. n. n.'s ed garsten was in toronto to see how fans there are getting set for this truly worldly series .
The blue <unk> may have flown the coop for a weekend in dixie but as sure as that flock from <unk> they'll be back in toronto in a few days bringing with them the fall classic for it's first trip across the border .
Note the call of the canadian blue jay bar fly .
Yes up here in the great white north there's still some confusion about just what this world series business is all about .
The world series was uh i think sponsored by the new york world in nineteen oh three or something like that .
Uh huh .
And in this town crazy about the crown the vans are <unk> <unk> about charges from across the border that they don't know about baseball as well as the yanks .
Well it really bothers me when you say stuff like that .
Americans are more naive about canada than canadians are about america i believe .
We know more about baseball than you give us credit for .
It's new .
It's a new experience .
It hasn't been around that long a winning team .
And we just don't know how to go about it .
Well fact is toronto has had a ball team in one form or another since one thousand eight hundred eighty five .
And longtime sports writer neil <unk> says the first really international world series was in nineteen fifty nine the cuban sugar kings against minneapolis .
And it was terrific .
I mean every night fidel castro would make the grand entrance five minutes before <unk> at nine o'clock o'clock and the fans would be up viva fidel .
Whether it's viva or <unk> the staff at the blue <unk> <unk> nest will be ready to catch any linguistic curve balls .
A lot of our staff are bilingual so there's a lot of different languages .
And it says it on their <unk> what they speak in the language that they speak .
Well even if you do understand english you might need a slight translation when it comes to the <unk> menu .
For instance they've got something called candy <unk> .
No it's not a dental device for sugar freaks .
It's good ol' cotton candy .
Or a course in hot hot mexican cold cold italian and ronald mcdonald with <unk> ' and fans can virtually eat their own world series and win in one game .
Yes all this gives way to some deep philosophical thought .
What i really like is a canadian city representing the american league .
And as detroit <unk> manager sparky anderson puts it well <unk> really about the same as new york or cleveland just smells better .
