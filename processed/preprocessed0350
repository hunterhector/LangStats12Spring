The <unk> summer in the u. s. is making life miserable throughout much of the eastern part of the country .
Correspondent deborah potter has more from washington .
From the nation's capitol up and down the east coast it was hard to find anyone who wasn't hot .
Add in the humidity and you're talking misery .
The weather service calls it the heat index .
We're trying to define with an apparent temperature if you will the temperature your body feels it is .
At mid day in washington the index hit one hundred seven high enough to be a health risk especially for the elderly .
It means stay inside preferably in an air conditioned space avoid any strenuous exercise outside and to drink plenty of fluid .
In new york some elderly residents took the advice and crowded into a senior center .
For some who had to work staying cool was almost impossible .
But at the midwest ice company in detroit the coolest place to be was on the job .
I was sweatin' like a dog before i came in and you know we ain't got nothin' but fans at home so i'm glad to be up in here now .
I'm cool very cool while y'all out there sweatin' i'm in here <unk> out real nice .
Outside the answer seemed to be water get near it or in it or get it in you .
Ice cream today 'cause it's <unk> everywhere so no one wants to buy it .
Is there any relief in sight .
The maps say no .
We've had a stagnant weather situation .
There's very little air motion outside so the middle atlantic states and the eastern seaboard are in for a heat wave for at least the next week .
Some at least aren't <unk> by the forecast .
Heat and cold affects the body but the soul is unaffected by these things .
So that's why we come out either way .
