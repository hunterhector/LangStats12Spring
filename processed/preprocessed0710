The nation of malawi is holding its first democratic elections today .
Voters are expected to unseat their president for life hastings <unk> <unk> .
Hello everyone i'm brian andrews cassandra henderson is on assignment .
This is a special edition of c. n. n. newsroom .
Malawi is in southeastern africa .
It is a poor nation .
On average citizens earn just over two hundred dollars a year .
The land has been inhabited by <unk> speaking peoples for two thousand years .
In one thousand eight hundred ninety one it was made a british colony called the <unk> of <unk> .
Following a freedom movement by hastings <unk> <unk> the <unk> became independent in nineteen sixty four .
The name was changed to malawi from the malawi kingdom established during the fifteen hundreds .
In nineteen seventy <unk> proclaimed himself president for life however a referendum showed that a majority of voters wanted to end one party rule .
<unk> was forced to call elections .
Today eight parties are going for one hundred seventy seven seats in the national assembly as well as the presidency .
Bob coen has more on the historic malawi elections .
Election fever is sweeping across the small african country of malawi as its people prepare for their first ever free democratic elections .
Overshadowed by the historic events in south africa the changes here are just as significant .
<unk> are not seeking change from white domination but one of the continents most oppressive dictators .
The world's oldest living ruler ninety six year old president <unk> <unk> declaring himself president for life after leading his country to independence thirty years ago he and his malawi congress party have ruled malawi with an iron fist .
There were a number of disappearances and killings in this country .
There was no freedom of association freedom of expression freedom of movement .
We were deprived of so many things .
Bowing down to international pressure and internal descent president <unk> conceded to holding the free elections following last year's referendum .
After decades of living in fear people are now free to speak openly .
There is a free press and a tangible feeling of excitement about the elections .
What we need you know is just a free country free democracy .
This is going to be our one opportunity to choose a government that we want .
<unk> now have eight political parties to choose from .
And the campaigning from the cities and the countryside has been greeted with the new founded enthusiasm for politics .
Although nearing one hundred years president <unk> is running as his ruling party's candidate .
But he has been seen less and less in public since undergoing brain surgery last year failing to turn up at several campaign events .
He has been called the invisible candidate of this election .
And although time may be finally catching up with president <unk> <unk> his ruling party is determined to continue with or without him .
Meanwhile the opposition parties rather than deal with real issues have focused on the need for change .
There has been one party for state for the past fifty years .
A government which has been very oppressive very <unk> and it was necessary that change come about .
But in a country where more than sixty percent of the people cannot read or write the holding of free and fair elections may be difficult .
The campaign has been marked by incidents of intimidation such as the use by the ruling party of traditional <unk> dances who are much feared for their magical powers .
Whatever the outcome of this election real change for a country with no experience of democracy will not be easy .
Many are looking to events in south africa as an example to follow .
My prayer is that if the <unk> could have the spirit the south africans have adopted to far of accepting each other and to live together and to work together in a then the results in this country will be great and we will be prosperous .
Finally malawi seems ready for the dawning of a new democratic era and the challenges that come with it .
