If you have a burning desire to visit the <unk> hotel in las vegas better not stand around very long .
The hotel that gangsters built will probably not be on the next national register of historic places .
C. n. n.'s ann mcdermott explains .
In the beginning the city of <unk> was somewhat sedate .
Las vegas nevada the entertainment and fun capital of the world where blue jeans and mink are a common sight side by side .
Then there was glitz incredibly garish glitz .
And today las vegas says let there be lions and castles pyramids and pirates .
Yup las vegas is changing again .
For one thing it's getting bigger .
In the next ten weeks another ten thousand hotel rooms will be built here .
The m. g. m. will boast five thousand rooms alone .
But they won't all be housing gamblers .
Families will fill them up too thanks to an adjacent theme park .
And that's the kind of people vegas is attracting these days the kind veteran <unk> <unk> and roy have always attracted .
Las vegas is the disney land of the adults and now it is the disney land of children as well .
Mcdermott but in making way for the new las vegas is <unk> a lot of the old like the last building of the old <unk> hotel .
It'll be <unk> and replaced never mind that it's the house that bugsy built or mr. siegel as he was sometimes called .
A <unk> says that's tearing down a bit of history .
Why because a gangster lived there .
Well sure .
Like chicago tried to make al <unk> house a historic landmark .
But las vegas is about newness and the director of the <unk> says <unk> old <unk> has got to go .
Does the corporation feel any kind of pang at all or maybe i'm being naive over losing an important part of its past .
No i don't think so .
Well he's not alone here .
Even visitors seemed eager to ring out the old .
I think it's great a lot of new hotels a lot bigger hotels .
A lot more casinos to lose your money at .
You might think this veteran vegas sign maker who sometimes wanders through his neon graveyard might get a little sentimental say over the <unk> imminent destruction .
After all that <unk> been a centerpiece of the city for years .
But what the heck that was yesterday .
They're going to be blowing up the dunes i guess very soon .
Right .
Is that going to give you any kind of a pang .
Number .
It'll be interesting to watch .
<unk> .
A somewhat cold <unk> bunch these las <unk> or maybe it's just self protection .
After all why get attached to things here .
It'll all just change again right pal .
