There seem to be plenty of people who remain undaunted and hard at work despite the sweltering temperatures .
For example a boston man who calls himself the <unk> .
He ties a sixty pound tank with tubes and <unk> to his back every <unk> and offers a thirst <unk> caffeine fix to commuters caught in traffic jams .
And the heat hasn't slowed his business .
The <unk> who usually charges a dollar for hot coffee will offer up an iced version for a buck fifty .
From member station wbur in boston tovia smith reports .
Nearly every <unk> has been there before .
It's rush hour you and a million other people are trying to squeeze into the two lanes going into the sumner tunnel .
As you've waited to pay your toll maybe you've seen the guy selling newspapers and the one selling flowers but boston may be the first city in the country offering its morning motorists a jolt of java .
Today we're serving a cinnamon with a little <unk> blend in it .
It's actually very excellent .
His real name is chris <unk> but he's been known to commuters as the <unk> ever since he hit the highway a year ago in a <unk> like space suit and a high tech contraption filled with <unk> beverages brewing on his back .
As you can see it's totally set up as an orthopedic back brace that supports the rest of the tank that holds the coffee .
It's double insulated maintains its heat temperature for i think it loses two degrees every three hours so it really stays i mean i've been out here below zero and above a hundred .
The <unk> is to tunnel traffic what the beer man is to the ball park and he's made a science of his service .
A plastic spigot tied to his right hand draws coffee from the tank on his back .
By his side another tube hangs down from a bottle filled with cream and a modified <unk> pouch around his waist carries sugar sweet 'n low <unk> and covers .
He's a walking water hole for caffeine craving commuters .
O. k. there is a method to this madness .
He can deliver coffee in zero point five zero seconds or less .
Here's how he maneuvers into position comes right at 'em how do you want it today my friend .
Black thanks .
Haven't seen you in while .
Most of his customers are regulars but with a captive audience caught in bumper to bumper traffic the <unk> has plenty of opportunity to solicit new business .
The <unk> got to be light on his feet .
Matter of fact i gotta show ya .
Here's how we do it right here .
Dancing between the buses <unk> around the taxis and the eighteen wheelers the coffee man goes in for the sell .
That's it .
That's how we do it .
We go right around they don't know what's going on then they want a coffee .
They say look at that guy <unk> hard out there .
He gets smiles and stares and more than once you can hear the automatic locks on car doors click closed as the coffee man approaches .
The <unk> goes at it .
Sometimes he's a little intimidating .
Again when he comes up to your window they get a little nervous .
I've been over to oh there's a little <unk> comin' through .
Look at that nice doggie .
See how intimidated they get .
He even scares the dogs .
It's unbelievable .
How are ya guy .
Good to see ya .
There's some of the white shirts as i call them .
They always get their nice white shirts .
They gotta make sure i give them a <unk> because you know they're good businessmen but they're sloppy drinkers .
They spill the coffee all over themselves so there's a limo driver .
He usually takes black .
I know just what he wants .
Good morning .
It's nearly nine o'clock a. m. now and nearly ninety degrees outside .
No one seems to be interested in hot coffee in this record breaking heat so the <unk> offers an alternative .
Watch this switch kids here we go .
Ice on this side .
With a new coffee cooler strapped to his back and a cooler of ice connected to his belt .
The coffee man gears up and goes out again into the traffic .
Ice cold .
Take care of you right into boston big guy .
The red eye from california this'll wake me up .
That'll wake you up my friend .
O. k. .
It's fifteen minutes and four <unk> later when the <unk> takes his first break .
Got a little technical difficulty here folks .
See this happens this is like nasa with the space shuttle .
What happens is i got a little o. ring here problem so i'm going to have to take and adjust it .
Won't take but a minute .
<unk> only out of action for a short time .
<unk> says he began selling coffee here after a career in real estate crashed and he lost everything .
Now he says he has a trademark pending and he's looking to franchise and send <unk> clones all around boston and beyond .
In the meantime he's got his hands full <unk> out coffee and providing something of a <unk> for bored and aggravated commuters .
They pull up in a miserable mood hi how are you .
Good to see the <unk> isn't it .
Oh yeah .
The only guy <unk> in the morning .
As far as the coffee man's concerned he has plenty to smile about .
In all the months he's been out here not a single boston driver has hit him and the noxious exhaust fumes have not yet made him sick .
The <unk> admits to some worry but nonetheless carries on .
Everybody's got their time and you really never understand why those things happen and i don't understand so i just you just have to go with the flow .
Here come some people .
And the flow today happens to be iced chocolate <unk> .
First sample is always for the nose .
Wow .
Unbelievable .
Strong .
Nice .
Just what they want to get goin' in the morning .
For national public radio this is tovia smith in boston .
