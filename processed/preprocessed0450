As with president clinton european leaders are expressing regret about the bloodshed in moscow but they are lining up behind president yeltsin saying he had no choice but to act .
C. n. n.'s rob reynolds has more on the european community reaction .
As the fighting in moscow raged european leaders once again pledged full support for russian president boris yeltsin .
I don't believe over the last day or so that president yeltsin had any choice but to act as he did and i very much admire his restraint over recent months .
There should be no doubt that he has our total and unequivocal support for the action that he's taken .
Foreign ministers of the twelve european community nations issued a statement backing yeltsin in his reforms .
We have to support those who want democratization and reforms in russia as mr. yeltsin and his .
It is extremely deplorable that his opponents have sought violence which has left president yeltsin very little choice i'm afraid .
We are anxious that he should continue on the path of reform .
That's what it's all about .
The violence in moscow is monitored closely by the german government which provides a large portion of russia's financial aid .
Violence is sometimes necessary in a situation which has gotten out of control to bring things back into line .
While european support for yeltsin is unanimous analysts say it may be a mistake to put all western eggs in yeltsin's basket .
Remember we went overboard on gorbachev his predecessor and were rather surprised when he was edged out .
I think if yeltsin is edged out we're not going to be really prepared for that .
I hope however that despite all this support that we're giving yeltsin somebody's making contingency plans for some kind of alternative .
Yeltsin's apparent victory in the latest crisis brought relief to european leaders but none could be confident that there would not be more instability in russia's future .
