While things seem very calm and deliberate here in the hall they were just anything but in the spin room backstage where gene randall is standing by .
Gene .
Catherine there is so much spinning going on in this room the only thing missing is toto the dog from the wizard of oz .
Here is some of what we've been hearing .
From marlin fitzwater president bush's spokesman at the white house .
A great victory for the president. he said bill clinton was <unk> the whole time .
He said clinton's lead has obviously gone to his head .
Fred malek the campaign chairman for the bush reelection team .
I think president bush clearly won the debate .
Malek says the critical question is that when people are asked which candidate they trust they will come down on the side of george bush .
Rich bond the chairman of the republican national committee .
Bill clinton was a poor third said bond because he was very weak and very cautious when he wasn't being smug and arrogant .
On the clinton side james carville clinton's top strategist he said there is a long time to go in the race and we'll still keep the pressure on .
But he said on clinton's performance i think he clearly won the debate .
I don't think anybody disputes that .
From ron brown the chairman of the democratic national committee .
George bush needed to hit a home run tonight .
He struck out again .
Bill clinton once again sounded presidential looked presidential acted presidential .
He is ready to become president .
And finally on the perot side .
Orson swindle said perot won it hands down .
He said it was a hell of a good night for perot .
So much for perot's claim that he has no spin doctors .
So then that's what goes on in this room .
If it wasn't nailed to the building it might fly out into orbit .
