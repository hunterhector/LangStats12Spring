We went to baltimore this week to see a movie star .
O. k. you young folks right in here .
Where you want to go .
Thank you very much .
Are you here to see marguerite .
The woman we went to meet doesn't do movies full time .
In fact it took her ninety one years to get her first role .
Marguerite <unk> has spent more than half her life waiting tables in an old fashioned restaurant on the corner of charles and pleasant streets in baltimore .
The woman's industrial exchange is a <unk> kind of a place with its doorman and <unk> and scratch baked orange <unk> .
It showed up briefly in nora <unk> film sleepless in seattle so miss marguerite got up on the silver screen .
She will make her entrance here soon .
First some history .
The woman's industrial exchange has been located in this four story red brick building since one thousand eight hundred eighty seven .
It's a combination restaurant bakery and gift shop .
Like a permanent church <unk> was one reporter's description of the sales room .
Manager rita knox says the exchange was launched as a sales room after the civil war .
When the men went off to the war the women were left at home and they didn't want anybody to know that they needed money and they were really hurting a lot of them .
And so they decided they would try to sell the things that they made by hand so the one woman said that she would take everything in her home and she would sell them and she would keep ten cents on the dollar .
And so it's been going on ever since .
On this day it's a red <unk> sweater which will join the other tokens appropriately <unk> and embroidered the <unk> ann dolls and the <unk> in the big woman's exchange sales room .
We admire the handiwork and the baked goods but we have come for another reason .
Oh yes .
Our star .
Your club will be right up .
O. k. .
Just a minute .
At ninety three marguerite <unk> is crisp and <unk> as a <unk> .
Pale red hair clear eyes behind not too thick glasses a micro striped blue and white uniform with no actual <unk> but a big white <unk> tied into a huge bow in the back miss marguerite has worked at the woman's industrial exchange since nineteen forty seven .
Before then she waited tables at other baltimore <unk> gentile places like this one filled with soft laughter and the <unk> of women's voices places with good names the dutch <unk> and the lovely lane .
Most of the woman's exchange waitresses have been here for years .
They're like family .
In fact miss <unk> identical twin sister worked here .
She died two years ago .
Having an identical twin on the premises posed some problems .
And when one went in one door one came out the other my sister did .
And one man said he said am i seeing things he said how could anybody work that fast he said you just went in the door and you came out. i said i have a twin sister .
He said would you mind getting her so when i get home i can tell my wife that i didn't drink anything .
In the almost half century marguerite <unk> has been at the woman's industrial exchange she has served some of old baltimore's elite .
I waited on mrs. decker you know black and decker and her sister fanny fox .
And i waited on i'm just trying to think mrs. <unk> .
I don't know if you remember her or not .
Waited on the lyons that lived up at <unk> park .
She and her sister they wore hats and gloves you wouldn't believe everything just so on them .
Now it's folks like us <unk> glove less .
We sit on what may be a leather <unk> <unk> in places with tape to hold it together resting our <unk> <unk> <unk> on a plain <unk> table .
The small blue menu lists fairly priced foods from your grandmother's recipe book tomato <unk> charlotte ruse <unk> tart .
All the baking and cooking is done by <unk> day wilson .
At age forty three miss <unk> represents the youth element at the woman's exchange .
She was fifteen when she started here setting tables .
Now she presides over the ovens and burners .
I learned by watching .
I pick up things by watching other people .
But aren't there things on this menu that have been here forever .
Yes menu do not come here .
Basically like last wednesday we had the fried tomatoes and bacon with the tomato sauce which is an excellent seller .
And we have fresh salmon fish that we serve as a special .
What's one today .
We have chipped beef on toast with <unk> .
I knew there'd be chipped beef here .
That's an old tradition very old .
It's well before lunch time and we didn't start out very hungry but it all sounds so good and we've come all this way .
So what do you recommend miss marguerite .
Honey everything is good .
Chicken salad is good chipped beef on toast crab salad crab cakes .
We order and miss marguerite <unk> <unk> off on <unk> legs .
At ninety three her steps are small but swift .
There's a good forty feet of <unk> black and white checked linoleum between our table and the kitchen .
Miss marguerite crosses it in eleven seconds .
We timed her and then we wait for our food just the way meg ryan and rosie o'donnell do in sleepless in seattle .
They come into the exchange for lunch .
A waitress enters screen right carrying trays .
She moves behind the actresses and puts the tray down .
Now you see her nose and glasses in the upper right corner .
She serves chicken .
Bringing in the chicken salad in that scene silent but alert baltimore's own marguerite <unk> her on screen time a full two seconds shorter than her real life march from table to kitchen .
We are luckier than meg ryan and rosie o'donnell .
With us miss marguerite has a speaking part .
Well this is what i served the stars .
Is that why you got it see what it was like .
Miss marguerite found making movies a bit repetitive .
She was fine but sometimes an actress would mess up .
She would bend down to get her handkerchief or kleenex and they would say cut right .
Then all the food came off the table had to go back to be made over again and brought back .
You don't know how many times i served that chicken salad special .
Now to us it seems a big deal that miss marguerite <unk> was in a movie but to her it was just a day's event .
Much more important to miss marguerite is the fact that she has come to work at the woman's industrial exchange for all these years .
Can you imagine not working .
No my son always says well you've got enough money for retirement now mother .
But i'm not ready to retire right .
How old is he your boy .
Sixty .
So but you feel you'll just work till you drop .
Is that your view .
Not if i listen to him i won't .
Only thing he said mother what i worry about is if i retire and you're still working everyone says and your mother's still working i said i'll promise you six months before your retirement i'll retire .
It's hard to sit in a one hundred seven year old restaurant talking with a ninety three year old woman and not ask for some advice on living .
Well you've gotta live a good clean life .
I mean you know my mother was strict with us so i mean i don't know any different you know and i mean i've never lost my manners yes sir no sir you know i never go huh .
Hah i mean like they do today right .
And it's the same with my son and his family .
I think it's the way you raise your child .
You know it's too bad because you see so many kids who are not .
Today it's terrible isn't it .
And their manners the way they talk to their own family .
Well you see i wouldn't tolerate that and neither would my son .
And i think they love their mother and father for that .
They can't do enough for them .
The advice is old fashioned but miss marguerite <unk> is a thoroughly modern woman independent .
Her husband who was an ambulance driver died twenty years ago .
She is forward looking worked all her life and raised a son who with his wife helps her stay busy and independent .
At the woman's industrial exchange in baltimore marguerite <unk> spends each day serving up dishes of delicious food plates piled <unk> with scoops of fresh <unk> <unk> crab meat salad chicken and then checking to see that her customers are satisfied .
Not the stuff of movies maybe but the way she tells it it's a wonderful life .
You having something else .
I guess we have to have desert don't we .
We have strawberry whipped cream tea cake and the ice cream charlotte is our favorite desert .
It's cake split with ice cream then more ice cream and cake chocolate sauce and whipped cream .
Or strawberry sauce .
That's really a popular desert .
Why don't you split one .
I mean whatever you want to do .
We could get one .
What's it called .
Woman's exchange charlotte .
Stamberg this is npr's weekend edition .
