Palestinians eager for autonomy cheered the arrival of a force of international observers today in the west bank city of hebron .
But that warm welcome ended quickly as new violence erupted between palestinians and israelis .
A. b. c.'s dean reynolds reports .
They are called a temporary international presence in the city of hebron .
A hundred or so norwegians danes and italians showed up today with the blessing of the israeli government .
Those foreigners with white uniforms will give a feeling of security a feeling of some change .
They are supposed to give that feeling to the palestinians of hebron thirty of whom were killed ten weeks ago by a jewish settler .
It is the first time israel has ever permitted a foreign force onto land it occupies .
The men in white say they will be neutral go betweens .
We are observers .
That's our job .
We observe .
And today they got an <unk> .
Within minutes of their arrival a familiar clash was underway with the combatants oblivious to the observers having a pretty hard time observing anything through the tear gas .
In gaza today a big crowd waited for the palestinian police force to come marching in from egypt .
But it never did .
The israeli army spent all day processing the palestinians' new weapons while the police cooled their heels on the other side of the border .
To many palestinians that was further evidence that israel is barely <unk> its grip .
They will keep controlling everything .
So what is the difference .
It was the same story in jericho .
They had a parade but the police force never made it in from jordan .
Just as in gaza there was no sign at all of the self rule promised in the agreement signed last week .
Apparently neither that nor much of anything else will happen until p. l. o. chairman yasir arafat names a new palestinian council to assume control from israel .
And the only person who knows when arafat will get around to doing that is arafat .
