I'm charles bierbauer in washington .
Within the hour lives have been lost in haiti after an explosion there near to demonstrations going on in the center or near the center of port au prince .
We go first to c. n. n.'s lucia newman for the latest on the scene in port au prince .
Lucia .
As you can see there are dozens of heavily armed u. s. army vehicles and soldiers people with their arms in the air holding their hands up as the soldiers try to get them out of this area known as kuwait city here .
Nearly two hours ago there was an explosion .
According to witnesses one that took place because of a grenade that left at least a dozen people injured according to one red cross official .
He said he saw five people dead .
There was pandemonium confusion and violence as people in the crowd started beating on some whom they suspected of having originated the attack .
When the soldiers finally came here to restore order there was a very dramatic moment when they burst into a warehouse with machine gun fire breaking down the door going inside and arresting or capturing one person whom at least the crowd believed was responsible for the grenade attack .
It's not sure that that was the case .
The man inside said that he was a painter that he was just a worker .
There are still hundreds and hundreds of people here .
They're screaming out justice screaming out that they wanted the return of president aristide .
This has been a very violent day .
As i said there were dozens of people very badly injured and it took a very long time for ambulances to come and get them out of there .
The soldiers are still looking for suspects looking for people who might have carried out this attack but there's very little concrete information as to who could have done it .
This is lucia newman reporting live from port au prince .
