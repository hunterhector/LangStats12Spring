It's easy to romanticize the life of a writer .
Take daniel pinkwater for example .
He doesn't have to get up and drive to an office every day .
He just gets out of bed has a <unk> breakfast and then <unk> into the next room to write .
If he has something to say that day great .
If not he takes a walk .
Not bad .
But pinkwater tells us the pressure on a writer can actually be terrible .
Professor george d. rose of johns hopkins university sent me e. mail to the effect that it was time i stopped <unk> around and wrote something really serious .
You know a big book .
George is one of my oldest friends .
He loves me and just wants to be more proud .
He wants my name to be mentioned together with those of umberto <unk> and tom robbins .
We were educated together at a college wherein every student was expected to write the great american novel or die in the attempt .
I tried to explain to george that i am not even trying to write the great american paragraph .
But i'm not satisfied with the job i did .
I want to try again here .
In <unk> new york an antique and picturesque town not far from where i live stands the <unk> arms advertised as the oldest inn in america and recently written up as one of the ten best restaurants .
I have eaten there many a time and it's really good .
Across the street is another restaurant calico .
It's tiny .
There's space for just six tables and a glass pastry case .
It's a charming room and it affords a view of the street and the handsome old inn .
A couple runs it .
He cooks .
She <unk> .
The menu is small .
One night i had the pan roasted breast of duck with wild rice <unk> and a cranberry champagne sauce that i can't quit thinking about .
Jill had the roast <unk> of pork inserted with hudson valley apples and served with potato and <unk> <unk> .
I judge a meal by what it does to my state of mind .
After that visit to calico our mood was to say the least elevated .
I have to say that part of our euphoria related to the fact that the experience wound up costing less than forty dollars .
Of course we didn't have appetizers .
We didn't have the <unk> <unk> with <unk> cheese served with a <unk> of wild mushrooms or the steamed manila <unk> with <unk> infused <unk> .
We did have astonishing french <unk> for dessert and a perfect cup of coffee .
After our meal we strolled the perfect streets of <unk> talking quietly feeling peaceful not big not prestigious or acclaimed just right .
George i can't promise i will ever write an important book .
But if you'll come to <unk> i'll take you to dinner .
