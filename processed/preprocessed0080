The long labor day holiday is the traditional american goodbye to the summer vacation months .
A group of new yorkers has come up with a somewhat outrageous <unk> to the season <unk> .
C. n. n.'s jeanne moos has the story .
That's one way to celebrate labor day this is another .
What you've got is <unk> sort of a parody of woodstock but the hippies have been replaced with drag queens men dressed as women their looks ranging from goldilocks to jackie kennedy .
Sometimes it's hard to tell and sometimes it's not .
Who are you again .
Now what are you .
La <unk> .
<unk> .
And what kind of is your theme .
Sad trash .
But there is nothing sad about <unk> least of all the entertainment .
There are performance artists and drag queens lip <unk> to recorded music .
Others like this billie holiday <unk> really sing .
From billie holiday to patsy cline .
<unk> is just about peace and love and beauty and <unk> .
<unk> were big this year so were leaves .
And who has to worry about sun when you bring your own shade .
It's water <unk> .
I was afraid it might be <unk> today .
There were guys with wigs and hair on their chin not to mention hair on their chest and there were quite a few with no hair at all .
It's your basic rug you know .
It's the kind i see the <unk> on c. n. n. wearing all the time .
The organizer of all this is known as lady miss bunny .
This is her eighth <unk> .
It and she have become new york institutions .
How long did it take you to get ready today .
Oh five or ten minutes .
I wear so little makeup .
She found this little old lady taking stock of <unk> .
Was she shocked .
It's a break in the monotony .
