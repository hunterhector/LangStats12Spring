The elite group of astronauts who flew the u. s. apollo moon missions lost one of its own this week .
Stuart <unk> was buried with full military honors thursday .
As c. n. n.'s john zarrella reports <unk> was part of an apollo flight that almost didn't make it to the moon .
Stuart <unk> flew in space only once but the nineteen seventy one apollo fourteen mission he was part of was critical .
It came on the heals of apollo thirteen which had to be aborted when an oxygen tank for fuel cells exploded .
Americans were questioning whether nasa had just been lucky on previous moon missions .
On apollo fourteen there was cause for concern again .
As command module pilot <unk> made several attempts to dock kitty hawk with the lunar module <unk> .
Finally on the sixth try it worked .
The crew could now head for the moon .
Alan shepard and edgar mitchell went down to the moon's surface .
<unk> stayed behind orbiting in kitty hawk .
During and in flight news conference on the way home <unk> talked of seeing the lunar lander as he <unk> above .
It just showed up as a white spot obviously something foreign to the lunar surface reflecting light .
<unk> was one of only six humans to ever circle the moon alone .
Those astronauts often joke their club is more exclusive than the club of twelve who actually walked on the lunar surface .
<unk> was <unk> .
He rarely took credit for himself .
He always praised his country first .
I want you to look up at that moon and i want you to visualize there are six united states flags planted across that moon .
At sixty one stuart <unk> died young from complications following an illness .
<unk> may not be one of the best known astronauts but he is still considered an american hero certainly by the other members of that exclusive club .
