On the popular daytime soap another world linda <unk> plays romance novelist felicia gallant .
Recently though <unk> left the soap to co star in an episode of perry mason .
The soap writers wanted to keep the emmy winning <unk> presence in the show until her return .
Well what to do .
For the july fourteenth episode <unk> <unk> will play the role of felicia gallant .
Senior entertainment correspondent bill tush explains .
Only in the world of soap operas could writers come up with a plot twist to temporarily replace one its stars so easily just put out the word that a linda <unk> look alike is needed .
Enter <unk> <unk> a new york attorney who has been told more than once that she looks like the actress .
I do look like her according to a lot of people .
So it was a natural thing for me to try out .
I had a lot of fun with it .
It wasn't something that i ordinarily would do .
But it paid off .
<unk> beat out the other <unk> clones to win the role and even had the chance to meet the lady herself .
I asked her if it was fun to come into a room of people who look like her or if it was strange .
And she thought it was fun .
And i asked her how it felt to look like me .
And here's <unk> doing her best to look and act like <unk> .
So maybe you saw her she's a very <unk> woman with your taste in <unk> actually .
Mine was the only hat on board except for that strange man with the <unk> .
I think he's following me .
Hey those years in the courtroom came in handy .
When one is in court as a litigator one can be theatrical in front of a jury .
And i suppose there are some similarities .
Could it be the show biz bug has bitten the litigator .
I suppose it would be nice to do it again .
I'm not necessarily sitting by the phone .
But if i had an opportunity i'd certainly answer it .
By the way in that perry mason episode linda <unk> is not playing a lawyer .
