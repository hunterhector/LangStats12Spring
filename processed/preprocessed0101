The glow has returned to the advertising industry's <unk> awards show .
Last year the ceremony degenerated into a grab fest but it was a different program in new york city tuesday night .
Here's c. n. n.'s sherrie dean .
How is this night different from all other nights .
There's an answer in one word <unk> .
With a sense of humor actor tony randall served as host to help launch the new <unk> awards tuesday night in new york city .
The awards for excellence in the advertising industry ended in disgrace last year when <unk> organizer bill evans failed to show up and ad executives from print and radio stormed the stage and just took awards .
A second ceremony for television commercials was simply canceled and bill evans filed for bankruptcy .
But the trademark for the <unk> was bought by ruth <unk> an advertising trade publisher .
What have you done to restore the integrity of the <unk> after what happened last year .
Well we're here tonight and that's a really big step i think the fact that the <unk> are ongoing and enduring .
But we did a few other things too .
We gave all of last year's winners their statuette .
Until last year's <unk> the <unk> awards were considered the oscars of the advertising industry .
This year however many ad agencies declined to submit entries .
But we are told by the organizers of the new <unk> awards that they still receive many many thousands of entries from some forty four countries around the world .
Advertising <unk> veronica <unk> came all the way from malaysia to see if she'd win .
And what would it mean to win a <unk> award .
Achievement of a lifetime i tell you .
That's to me the <unk> the ultimate .
And the scandal from last year doesn't mean anything to you .
Not now .
It's a new <unk> to me .
Jack <unk> production company chose not to enter the competition this year .
We were curious as to whether the <unk> awards would be able to spring back to their former <unk> in one short year .
The evening ceremony went off without too many <unk> .
More than eighty winners were called to the stage but nobody was allowed to make an acceptance speech .
The commercials themselves were the stars of the event .
The winners were chosen by a panel of thirty five high ranking advertising executives .
They did a superb job on the judging process .
They managed it as professionally as i've ever seen and i've been in this business for twenty five years .
And what of bill evans the man who ran the old <unk> .
Well he was nowhere in sight .
