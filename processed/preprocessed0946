It seems every christmas season we hear at least one tragic story a faulty wiring in christmas lights causing tragic results .
C. n. n.'s ed garsten reports on one's family's loss as well as the loss in reputation of a name some people trust .
Three days before christmas nineteen ninety the <unk> home in canton michigan erupted in flames .
Martin <unk> and six of his nine children died in the fire a fire caused by faulty lights igniting the family christmas tree .
Four years later deborah <unk> recalls how careful she tried to be .
I looked for the <unk> label when i purchased christmas lights because to me that was like a good housekeeping seal .
It mean that that product had been tested and that it was a safe product .
But it wasn't .
She successfully sued underwriters laboratory the manufacturer of the lights and the california company <unk> the company whose name is on the box but merely packs the bulbs and wires and <unk> them .
First of all we saw a large number of the light bulbs had a wire that was sticking out .
You combine this with a problem with the wiring which we discovered it's called reverse polarity what you have is a likelihood of sparking or <unk> which is basically akin to a toaster in a christmas tree .
Underwriters laboratory would not comment on camera about the <unk> suit issuing this statement that the settlement did not construe liability .
But the independent testing company did say it has rigorous standards for christmas lights .
We look at twenty individual construction features even before we start testing .
If all those construction features meet the requirement then we have a whole battery of tests that we run through .
But these copies of <unk> inspection forms show that when field auditors as they're called paid visits to <unk> taiwan suppliers there were no lights available to inspect .
Each visit lasted about fifteen minutes .
What <unk> basically did was allow everyone else to fall asleep at the switch because if <unk> wasn't vigorously enforcing the standard then you can be sure that the manufacturer and distributor weren't all that concerned about it .
<unk> refused to comment .
There are a few precautions you could take before you buy .
One is simply to do a visual inspection of the bulbs .
Make sure there are no bare wires coming out of the socket .
Another good idea is if you're going to hang the lights inside is to have a smoke detector in the same room .
And then there's this product that's been around for a couple of years it's a christmas ornament you can hang on your tree that's also a smoke detector .
The <unk> name though is still one label many consumers insist on .
I don't know what it means but if it's on the package i would think that it would be safe .
I like to see it on everything i buy .
But for deborah <unk> who depended on it four years ago .
It doesn't mean anything to me now .
