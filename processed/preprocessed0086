Japan's government is giving some plots of land away as part of an effort to lure young people back to the farm life .
C. n. n.'s eileen o'connor reports .
The land of the rising sun nurtured not by the young but by the old .
Michiko was born in the <unk> era masako was too .
They would like their grandchildren to sew these fields and keep the land as it is and as it was for generations .
My sons tell me don't worry about the land just leave it says michiko but both of them work for companies .
So it is left to the elderly to worry and care for this land .
Masako knows the <unk> of a good harvest and the pleasure of living with nature .
We have no choice she said .
Young people should do whatever they want .
But that choice is worrying even the government .
On some areas land is being given away to lure the young back to the earth .
Japan has always subsidized its farmers so as not to rely on outsiders for rice .
But it may be that money alone will not guarantee that self <unk> in the future for it is people that are needed .
When i was a small child i helped my parents plant the rice by hand says michiko one by one .
Now it is machinery that runs in the fields not the children .
But still the elderly believes that tradition will not die that the era of the japanese rice farmer is not over yet .
