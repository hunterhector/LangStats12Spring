Developments continue to unfold on this important day in moscow .
C. n. n. correspondent claire shipman is there .
Hello claire .
Bob what you're seeing now are crowds outside of the front of the white house and what we saw just a few minutes ago was a large crowd people emerging from the white house .
We saw a few white flags flying .
We have not been told that this is a surrender in fact we have heard rumors that they may be bringing out wounded .
But we did see two white flags flying and a large crowd of people emerging from the white house and some ambulances in the area and there has been no gunfire to speak of for the last well there it is again .
But it had been quiet for the last five or ten minutes .
So they may be <unk> the wounded right now .
Claire when you say large crowd i realize this is awfully imprecise .
Can you take a guess at the size of that crowd that came out .
Well the crowd as massed as you see it now seems to be a least one thousand maybe two thousand people .
The crowd that emerged from the white house was probably somewhat smaller .
There was a crowd outside that seemed to go up the steps to meet them and they've merged together .
We couldn't really give you an accurate estimate of the crowd that came out .
All right .
Developments continue to evolve in moscow .
There are now then at least clearly somewhat fewer people inside the russian white house now than there were half an hour ago and have been all night .
Apparently some of the wounded being brought out perhaps some others .
