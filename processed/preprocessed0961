Japan is not accustomed to publicly airing the dirty laundry of its societal problems but one of those problems affecting young teenagers is suddenly in the spotlight .
Prime minister <unk> <unk> is ordering japanese education officials to do something about school yard bullying .
It's long been a japanese fact of life and now apparently has caused two teenage suicides .
C. n. n.'s andrea koppel reports .
Since the time he was in the sixth grade <unk> <unk> had led a tortured life .
He'd been beaten humiliated almost drowned and forced to steal thousands of dollars from his family .
After two years of bullying on november twenty seventh <unk> mother found his body behind the family's house hanging from this <unk> tree .
He was thirteen .
They asked us why we couldn't see the symptoms but i didn't know the bullying was that serious .
I believed he would tell us if there was something terrible going on but i was a fool .
In a four page suicide letter <unk> told his family what he'd had trouble telling them while he was still alive .
He wrote why did i not die earlier .
Because my family was gentle to me .
It was easy to forget what happened at school however these days they bully me so hard and demand large sums of money although i have none .
I can't stand it anymore .
<unk> suicide has shed new light on a darker side of this country's exceptionally rigid system of education a system that tells children to be different to stand out is wrong .
You're taught that if you're the victim of bullying it's your problem and you're expected to endure the suffering in silence .
This year seven school age children like <unk> are reported to have killed themselves because they were <unk> .
But only now after the death of <unk> is japan's minister of education reacting publicly .
Those who did this bullying should come forward to parents and teachers .
School teachers and officials should be tough on these students .
No matter how young they are there are laws to punish them .
I believe proper steps should be taken .
Since november twenty seventh authorities in the farming community of <unk> city where <unk> grew up have been inundated with phone calls from angry parents all over japan .
It turns out that for the past three years <unk> junior high school has had a special committee in place to deal with bullying .
But when <unk> case was brought before the committee on three separate occasions it was ignored .
Why .
Because like a well behaved japanese school boy <unk> denied he was being <unk> .
