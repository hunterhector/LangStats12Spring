A new movie from danny devito <unk> comes home and an unusual board game that runs in you v. c. r. .
Dennis michael has the details in this week's home video preview .
If jack the bear is a little obvious it's also very heart felt .
Danny devito does good work as a single father who may just be a little too well connected with his inner child .
A good alternative choice which may surprise you .
We don't usually mention <unk> products in home video preview .
The number one hits of the beatles video disk is worth a listen though if not a look .
The music comes without lead vocals so you can sit in for john or paul but the whole idea is marred by poorly chosen terrible archive footage of the <unk> .
And while on the subject of low rent <unk> there's nightmare the video board game .
The game's your standard setup with markers and dice and cards but at the same time you're supposed to running your v. c. r. with this tape in it so this guy can scream orders at you in a terrible accent like this .
Fun huh .
If this one catches on look to <unk> to nightmare like migraine or root canal .
See you at the rental counter .
