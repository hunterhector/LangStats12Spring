Doctors are reporting a sad down side to the medical revolution many prematurely born babies are surviving but some are disabled and blind and cannot walk or have learning problems .
Since the early nineteen eighties advances in medicine have saved many babies under two pounds who would have died .
Some would be mothers may be endangering their health in their quest to have a child .
Now in this study indicates a popular fertility drug can increase the risk of ovarian tumors c. n. n.'s andrew holtz has details .
Doctor ana murphy is examining dana barry using ultrasound .
Here's your uterus right there o. k. and you can see the <unk> stripe .
She is looking for signs that he drug <unk> is prompting ovulation in order to increase dana barry's chances of becoming pregnant .
But <unk> also know as <unk> or <unk> may also increase risks of disease .
According to a study that concludes infertile women have more than double the normal risk of ovarian tumors .
Including both cancers and benign growths .
We found that most of the increased risks of ovarian tumors was concentrated in the <unk> of women who had taken the drug <unk> and who had taken it for a year or more .
Yet even in this group of women ovarian tumors are uncommon .
The researchers calculate that during a twelve year period following treatment <unk> raises the risk of an ovarian tumor from about one in five hundred to about one in fifty .
Furthermore many of the women who develop ovarian tumors a number of these are not of the most serious form and could be cured .
Based on earlier reports doctors had suspected drugs that stimulate the <unk> might lead to more tumors but this study more clearly defines the risk of long term <unk> use .
I think that most of us will examine more carefully our use of <unk> and how many cycles these patients are on .
So yes i think this to a large extent will make a difference of how we think of <unk> as a drug .
Yet <unk> which is used hundreds of thousands of times a year in the u. s. will likely remain popular .
The alternatives to <unk> are injected drugs rather than pills .
They require more intensive monitoring and care and they cost more .
And switching treatments wouldn't necessarily eliminate the risk of ovarian tumors .
It's a risk dana barry is willing to accept .
I will still take it because without this i won't <unk> and without <unk> i would not have a baby so you know there is not very many choices here .
An expanded study is already planned in order to learn more about links between fertility treatment and ovarian tumors .
