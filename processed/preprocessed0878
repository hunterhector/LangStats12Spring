President clinton hit the campaign trail last night speaking loudly and carrying a big stick .
C. n. n. correspondent claire shipman is live at the white house with the story .
Good morning claire .
Good morning bob .
Now despite all the talk that some candidates view president clinton as a liability he's been on the stump lately for a number of fellow democrats .
Last night he attended two fundraisers for incumbent senator charles robb who's in a tight and highly publicized race with oliver north .
And despite his recent <unk> of bipartisanship he lashed out at the republicans .
And they raise more money than we do to turn their opponents into aliens right .
How do they do that .
They do that by <unk> fear over hope by <unk> blame over responsibility by <unk> division over unity .
That is what they do .
And they are brilliant at it .
They sort of try to turn you into a space alien .
I tell people you know and they are devoted to it .
And they are brilliant at saying one thing and doing another .
The president seems to appeal mostly to democratic candidates badly in need of cash because despite his image problems he can still rake in millions of dollars .
Now for the next few days president clinton has a chance to turn his attention away from politics and toward president <unk> nelson mandela's visit .
Aids say there hasn't been so much excitement around the white house in years and in fact the state dinner tonight is said to be the hottest ticket in town since the inauguration .
Now for mr. mandela it's largely a fundraising mission .
For the president they're calling it a success story a chance to celebrate a success story that they in fact can take some credit for .
