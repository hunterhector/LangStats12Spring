Actor jeff goldblum played a self centered journalist in the big chill a scientist who turned himself into an insect in the fly and an alien in earth girls are easy .
Well this time out in deep cover goldblum plays a lawyer who is drawn to the wrong side of the law .
Cynthia <unk> has the story .
In deep cover jeff goldblum <unk> a charming ambitious attorney with a double life .
I'm a lawyer articulate successful with a family man a wife and a daughter .
But i've got this secret <unk> dark shadow life as a big time drug dealer .
Seduced by the power and wealth provided by his criminal enterprise goldblum forms a partnership with a dealer played by larry <unk> .
Little does he know his partner works undercover for the d. e. a. .
While working on the film goldblum met a lawyer who'd had a similar experience .
He'd started out defending drug dealers and then kind of getting involved with taking drugs himself and then dealing drugs .
It made goldblum wonder why people become involved at all .
The interesting thing to me i suppose is addressing the reasons for drug use or alcohol use and that has to do with the stresses and <unk> elements of life otherwise bad parenting even .
By the way bad parenting is the subject of <unk> next film fathers and sons .
He <unk> a hard drinking belligerent film director who decides to change his ways following the death of his wife .
I quit the movie business i try to salvage something with my son give him something that i obviously hadn't given him before and couldn't give to my wife .
That's not all his character gives away .
At first when i heard what the plot was about i couldn't quite picture you playing the father of a teenage son .
Can you picture yourself .
Oh that's very flattering thanks .
You mean i'm too young .
Well something like that .
But at age thirty nine goldblum isn't thinking about children right now .
