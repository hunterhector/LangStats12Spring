The climax of the military operation in haiti could come when president aristide returns home but some are asking how will aristide remain safe when so many of his armed enemies are on the loose .
C. n. n.'s special assignment correspondent brian barger has looked at how the united states plans to protect haiti's democratically elected president .
On the streets of haiti exiled president jean bertrand aristide is hailed as a savior but behind the scenes of jubilation u. s. intelligence officials are concerned about hundreds of heavily armed men in and out of uniform awaiting vengeance .
There's a great deal of hatred towards aristide as the symbol now i think of the destruction of the military .
Perhaps there is a belief that if he were assassinated then what he stands for would also be severely damaged .
To protect haiti's president the state department says it is now training a sixty man body guard contingent .
For backup u. s. security experts are being hired to support and further train aristide's bodyguards .
U. s. intelligence will also play a role according to officials .
A five million dollar c. i. a. covert action plan calls for efforts to neutralize haiti's para military groups the attaches .
The attaches are basically armed thugs who are licensed by the military to issued an i. d. card and a small payment as to operate as <unk> to the police in well intimidating the population essentially .
The u. s. military and international police monitors soon to be deployed in haiti will be trying to keep haiti's military in check to prevent them from mounting yet another coup against haiti's first democratically elected president .
U. s. officials are clear that building and keeping and keeping democracy alive in haiti hinges on keeping its president alive .
For aristide himself there's only one solution .
To disarm the para military groups is indispensable for the success of the nation .
We should disarm them and very quickly .
