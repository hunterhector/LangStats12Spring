This is john cochran on capitol hill where overnight opinions had hardened and bob dole who only yesterday spoke of a little strain in relations with russian today called for a suspension of aid unless russia <unk> and stops spying .
This affair threatens the foundation of our relationship with the new republic of russia .
The democrat who heads the senate intelligence committee also called for a freeze which will please some folks back home .
In my state already i'm asked you know why did you support foreign assistance in the first place for russia .
We shouldn't be taken for fools .
There's no sense in giving aid to countries that are going to spy on us .
The fact that it's an american accused of spying seemed to make no difference .
The case is an embarrassment for president clinton who before last month's trip to moscow urged congress to continue a fourteen billion dollar aid package even though clinton had been briefed on russian spying .
So far clinton is resisting pressure to suspend aid .
Most of our government aid is in the form of aid to take down the nuclear weapons .
And i don't think anyone thinks we should slow that up .
But for the first time in weeks talk shows had something besides tonya and nancy to discuss .
I think that as far as russia's concerned the next time they want a few tons of wheat we should tell them to grow it themselves .
In russia an intelligence spokesman said americans are typically overreacting .
We don't make a big fuss out of it .
Why should americans use the occasion just to provoke tension between our countries .
Even congress admits the russians are only doing what americans spies do .
As senator exon from nebraska said if we don't have spies over there then we should have .
