Today is may day .
For decades on this day red square was filled with banners flags military hardware a lineup of communist leaders and the communist working masses .
Not any more .
Here's c. n. n.'s eileen o'connor .
No it isn't marx <unk> and lenin this may day it was <unk> king mouse and grandma <unk> red square celebrating spring .
Forgetting all the work ahead on what was worker's day .
Gone were the regimental dancing the requisite chanting .
It's now basically a celebration says <unk> the dog .
In the past we drank .
Now we have fun king mouse adds .
Life's a little tense says granny but we believe everything will be okay .
That is not a view shared by all .
What's there to celebrate say many of these communists criticizing the yeltsin government .
They ridiculed the advertisements sold around red square to bank roll the festivities .
When am i ever going to go the canary islands <unk> olga .
It's a mockery to our poor people .
Freedom for her says <unk> we're just getting ripped off .
Clearly the big red square sell off was not a huge success .
Even western businesses could not take advantage of the one day offer of using the former seed of communism as one big capitalist billboard a madison avenue dream but a logistical nightmare few ad agencies could overcome in time .
Still it didn't matter as people took advantage of any excuse to forget the day to day and tango with the tuba .
