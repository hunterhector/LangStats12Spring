C. n. n.'s tom mintier reports .
Many tourists who come to bangkok leave with this memory traffic jams and air pollution .

Welcome to the thai house an oriental version of a european bed and breakfast or an australian farm stay .
During your vacation you live and eat as a local .
The surroundings are classical thai just as you might have experienced a hundred years ago .
<unk> <unk> built the thai house three years ago on a small piece of land just outside bangkok .
I make it very simple and easy nothing but a luxury thing .
There's no air condition and outdoor the real thing even the wood .
Even the bedroom is living on the floor thai style old style .
And to visit there you like it .
So far there's nobody complained .

Students are taught about thai spices and vegetables how to prepare famous dishes like spicy shrimp curry .

John <unk> is a biologist .
He says a hotel may be more luxurious but .
Impersonal .
A hotel is the same all over the world .
The thai house is a family home which you can experience in thailand .
John and his friends did find some excitement during their stay a ride along the <unk> in a long tail boat .
With a huge truck engine providing the power it would be a ride remembered for a long long time .
But thailand is a nation of contrasts .
You can also find peace and quiet in a place like this .
