If you've never been to a third world country coming to haiti can be shocking .
Basics that many take for granted such as covered sewers and clean water are in short supply .
The main problem is that it's right now getting the health volunteer agencies into the country being able to distribute supplies and provisions to the populous .
I think that for people i think that my vision is that we should improve the infrastructure and open more these hospital for the community .
If you are seeing the area where about one million people are living there is the biggest hospital is probably the only facility health facility that they have .
I am a religious woman and many of the people that come here still have a lot of life left in them .
Their families have rejected them and so we must be their families .
So we stay here and we love them and we live as a family .
I don't think we can see things turn around within the next few weeks or even the next few months .
It will take years .
But that doesn't mean because it's going to take a long time that anyone should give up or call it a hopeless situation .
