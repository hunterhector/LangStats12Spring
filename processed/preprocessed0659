New computers offer faithful electronic servants that can handle more and more tasks on their own .
But could they turn against their masters .
Also the old familiar emergency broadcast system is about to get a high tech replacement that will get the word out to more people if they're in danger .
And some teachers who make science and math classes exciting get credit for it this week .
Those stories and more are just ahead .
Hello i'm miles o'brien .
For those of you who aren't surfing in cyberspace there is a digital revolution underway and it's about much more than computers .
It's about the way we perceive the machines and the people who use them .
It's a revolution in computer culture .
They are nerds but they're hip and they're proud .
Dial in and log on .
The digital generation has hit its stride and found its voice and it is wired .
Wired is vanity fair for propeller heads and for people who wish they'd been propeller heads but probably weren't good enough at math in college .
Where computers communications and the media converge so called multimedia you'll find wired magazine .
It has become the monthly manifesto of the technological and cultural revolution .
Suddenly it seems it is chic to be a computer geek .
<unk> has gone from being a cult to being a culture .
They become the culture .
The culture of america today is the geek culture of ten years ago .
That's what's happened .
What has happened at wired is proof there must be something to this .
A little more than a year after the first issue circulation is a quarter of a million advertisers are in love and top writers are on the <unk> .
We've tapped into something that very few people realized was missing .
Co founders jane <unk> and louis <unk> run wired from a converted warehouse in san francisco brimming with twenty something digital <unk> .
The success of wired reflects an attitude in culture about technology which is that it is not longer the realm of either the super educated or you know the super <unk> .
Not long ago computers were closeted away in climate controlled rooms and computer users well revenge of the nerds comes to mind .
Hey take it easy .
The computer is your friend .
Today computers have come out of the closet plugged into a global network and along the way made a much wider circle of friends .
People are starting to say hey wow there's a lot of stuff going on and that can be really cool .
Tell me more about it and get involved .
And you know they're not real <unk> maybe as much as they might have been before .
There are other clues to this cyber sea change .
Just around the corner from the offices of wired magazine here on the edge of san francisco's multimedia district during a lunch hour you can see the people with the creative vision for this emerging industry look a lot more like artists than engineers people like <unk> <unk> just starting in a multimedia computer company .
I never thought that i would be so interested in computers .
Used to be the domain of nerds .
Yes .
Now you said it was what .
It's hip .
It's very hip .
Check out the scene down the street .
At this coffee house computer conversations and <unk> go hand in hand for people like turner morgan .
Is it chic to be a geek .
Yeah it's getting there .
I don't know .
It's sort of like the hundredth monkey theory .
After a while we reach the hundredth monkey and all of the sudden it was o. k. to have a computer and to talk about your computer .
And talk to <unk> paul <unk> .
We absolutely are a very wired plugged in band .
His group <unk> wouldn't exist without computers .
They use them to <unk> create videos and e. mail their fans so called <unk> <unk> with a sense of style .
You'll find them at frenetic dance parties called <unk> .
I think that's still very much a fringe movement still and it is still comparatively very very small .
And i think the mainstream still finds a lot of that stuff kind of <unk> .
But fringe movements have a way of becoming mass <unk> .
<unk> may be to the nineties what <unk> were to the fifties .
It was the <unk> who set the stage for the hippies .
So the <unk> minority today is similarly setting the stage for a very large social movement in the later half of this decade .
At wired they are true believers as well as <unk> of the digital revolution .
I think we're just at the cresting edge of it .
I think in the course of the next five to ten years we'll really going to be seeing radical changes .
It may be chic to be a geek now but it could be essential when the dust settles on this revolution .
The promise of a digital revolution is a better life by being plugged into the information superhighway or as they say at wired the <unk> .
Up next you'll meet some electronic alter egos which can help you find your way on the <unk> .
